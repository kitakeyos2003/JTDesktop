## Introduction

J2ME is a Java platform designed for resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones and embedded systems. It has been widely used for developing applications for feature phones in the past. However, with the advancements in technology and the popularity of smartphones, many developers are looking to migrate their J2ME projects to more modern platforms.

The J2ME to Java Swing Project Converter provides a solution to this problem. It allows you to convert your J2ME projects to Java Swing, which is a powerful and feature-rich UI framework for desktop applications. By converting your J2ME project, you can leverage the capabilities of Java Swing and easily adapt your application to run on desktop computers.

## Installation

To use the J2ME to Java Swing Project Converter, you need to include the library in your Java project. You can download the library JAR file from the [releases](https://github.com/kitakeyos2003/JTDesktop/releases) section of this repository. Once you have the JAR file, you can add it to your project's classpath.

## Usage

Using the J2ME to Java Swing Project Converter is straightforward. You need to follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary classes from the library into your Java code.
2. Create an instance of the `Application` class.
3. Use the `start` method of the converter instance, providing the path to your J2ME project as a parameter.
4. The converter will analyze the J2ME project and generate the corresponding Java Swing code.

Make sure that your J2ME project follows the standard structure and conventions to ensure a successful conversion process.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the J2ME to Java Swing Project Converter:

```java
import com.barteo.emulator.app.Application;
import me.kitakeyos.MGOMidlet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application application = new Application("Gopet", MGOMidlet.class, (short) 400, (short) 300, args, "/icon.png");
        application.start();
    }
}
```
